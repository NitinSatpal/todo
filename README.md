Which point / part was the most difficult to solve / implement for the levr-todo project? Why? And
which one the easiest one? Why?

	=> I won't say toughest but the time taking - It was working with react. Because this was the first time I worked in reac and I really enjoyed it, but it took some time for me to understand the real react way.
	Though I left some things for this asignments, like error display has one issue - even though the error occurs in second form field, it makes the firs field red and I really left it or the nice UI.
	Everything became easy as soon as I dive in it. But I will say feathers js was quite easy for me to catch up, probably because I am more into backend from the start.


If you have to choose other ​ stack​ to implement the todo-levr project, which one will be and why?
	=>I want to be very frank for this question. For any project, I always analyse which tech will best suit the requirement, but while hunting for the job and getting you call, I was in the state of mind that I want to grab the opportunity and for that I should deliver the assignment ASAP. So, I may not have analyse much on the task and would have chosen MEAN stack as I am too much comfortable with angularjs than react js.	


If you are ​ managing a project and the client has already an existing team of junior PHP developers
with a half backed project, asking for help to finish or migrate to a new technology, considering that will
take the same amount of time doing both things (finishing in PHP with the team or training +
implementing it in a new stack), what will you recommend to the client and why?

	=>That really depends. It's not about the amount of time I need to spend to train them + developing in new stack or to complete the half coded application. Even though that time is same, there are few things I will consider to take the decision:

	* What does their website tying to achieve
		-> Does it need a lot of data processing on backend
		-> Does it need freshness of data every now and then
		In this case, I will definitely go with some high performing stacks and tain their developers into it.

		But on the ohter hand, if their site is not more into data processing and can be cached without any worry of data freshness, then I will complete the half coded app into PHP along with their developers.

		Reason being, even if I will train them in new technologies, I will be with them till the end of the project and later they will end up on their own and they will have to continuosly learn new things for their website which they could have easily done in PHP without any performance degradation (given our analysis of their website. PS: We will analyse it ckeeping future in mind),

		While about their learning curve, they can learn these new techs and other modern day stacks without developing their own company webstie in them.

		So, if the website can work well with PHP, it would be great if they continue in it and devlier everything fast even when I am not with them and at the same time they can always learn new techs side by side, rather then spending time on learning and delivering at the same time which may cause wrong decisions and future issues.

Let’s say tech is not a choice, what else would you like to do to make a living and why? For
example... Artist because i'm extremely creative and appreciate beauty, etc...
	=> I love food and I am also a good cook. So I would have like to open  some uniqu kind of restaurant. What unique, I do not know now, because currently I have tech as a choice :) ButI would have thought something unique in absence of this technology thing.
